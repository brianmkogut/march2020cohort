        <h2>A little about Joye and her Life</h2>
            <p>Joye says that she feels lke she was so lucky to grow up 
                in "perfect harmony", being raised by both parents who were 
                famous, professional, working musicians in New Orleans.  They were
                 making a difference with their music!  Joye's mom, Marion Hebert, 
                who played the trumpet, created the first all female band in 
                the early 1930's called "Marion Hebert and her all girl orchestra".
                Her father played the saxophone and clarinet in Val Barbara's band 
                on the Steamer President.  This helped Joye develop a true love for music and 
                she started practicing in her living room, mastering the trumpet, guitar,
                piano, and drums.  Joye later played drums professionally in a group
                called "Sister Beat" and in a rock band called "The Rainbow".  Joye
                then realized she wanted to make a difference not only with her music but with specific
                lifestyle changes she experienced herself.  As a result of her lifetime of 
                healthy living and education, Joye would love to share with you her 
                innovative and highly successful path to health and well-being.</p>
